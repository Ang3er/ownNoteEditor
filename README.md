# ownNoteEditor
JavaFX editor for the ownNote files locally stored in ownCloud folder

This is (so far) mainly a self-learn project to understand how JavaFX works. Uploaded here since it might be useful/helpful for others.

Aim was to mimic the behaviour of the ownNote web client using JavaFX and working directly on the owNote files in a local ownCloud directory. This code does NOT update any of the SQL tables used by owNote - but so far this doesn't seem to impact anything.

See https://github.com/Fmstrat/ownnote for ownNote.

DISCLAIMER: This has been tested randomly with my ownNote files. Use at your own risk!
